# Roadmaps System Plan

## Vision
A dynamic, user-friendly Roadmaps page where users can:
- Track their learning journey through structured roadmaps.
- Progress through milestones, levels, and challenges.
- View achievements, progress, and unlockables.
- Join study groups and collaborate.

Admins can:
- Create/edit/delete roadmaps, milestones, levels, and challenges from the admin dashboard.
- Assign prerequisites, deadlines, and rewards.
- Monitor user progress and engagement.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Roadmap
- **Title** (e.g., "Full Stack Development")
- **Description**
- **Icon/Theme**
- **Levels** (ordered)
- **Visibility** (public/private)

### 2. Level
- **Title** (e.g., "Frontend Mastery")
- **Order**
- **Milestones** (ordered)
- **Unlock requirements** (optional)

### 3. Milestone
- **Title** (e.g., "React.js Basics")
- **Description**
- **Challenges** (ordered)
- **Due date** (optional)
- **Reward** (badge, points, etc.)

### 4. Challenge
- **Title** (e.g., "Build a ToDo App")
- **Description**
- **Type** (quiz, project, reading, etc.)
- **Resources** (links, files)
- **Completion criteria**

### 5. User Progress
- **Current roadmap, level, milestone, challenge**
- **Completion status**
- **Achievements/unlockables**
- **Study group participation**

## Database Structure (MongoDB Example)

- `roadmaps`
  - _id
  - title
  - description
  - icon
  - levels: [ { ...level } ]
  - visibility

- `levels`
  - _id
  - roadmapId
  - title
  - order
  - milestones: [ { ...milestone } ]
  - unlockRequirements

- `milestones`
  - _id
  - levelId
  - title
  - description
  - order
  - challenges: [ { ...challenge } ]
  - dueDate
  - reward

- `challenges`
  - _id
  - milestoneId
  - title
  - description
  - type
  - resources
  - completionCriteria

- `user_roadmap_progress`
  - _id
  - userId
  - roadmapId
  - currentLevelId
  - currentMilestoneId
  - completedChallenges: [challengeId]
  - achievements

## Admin Dashboard Features
- CRUD for roadmaps, levels, milestones, challenges.
- Drag-and-drop ordering.
- Assign prerequisites and rewards.
- Analytics: user progress, challenge completion rates.

## User Features
- Browse available roadmaps.
- Visual progress tracker (roadmap > level > milestone > challenge).
- Start/pause/resume roadmaps.
- Complete challenges and unlock achievements.
- Join study groups for collaborative learning.

## UI/UX Principles
- Clean, step-based navigation (roadmap > level > milestone > challenge).
- Progress bars, badges, and visual feedback.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Motivational elements (rewards, streaks, leaderboards).

## Example User Flow
1. User browses roadmaps and selects one to start.
2. User sees levels and milestones, with progress indicators.
3. User completes challenges within milestones.
4. Upon milestone/level completion, user unlocks rewards.
5. User can join study groups for each roadmap.

## Next Steps
- Implement new database models and API endpoints.
- Build admin dashboard interfaces for roadmap management.
- Develop the new Roadmaps page UI for users.
